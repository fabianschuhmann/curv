# Curvature calculation for membranes

A more detailed explanation will follow. For now, the quick and dirty installation is as follows:

```
git clone <this-repository>
```
move into the cloned directory
```
pip install -e .
```

Note, that at this time, imports are not fixed yet. So it might not work not going into the -e mode in pip. This can be considered an early alpha version.

The individual functions can be accessed through a cascade of help messages to be displayed with -h, i.e.

```
curv -h
```
or
```
curv calculate -h
```
